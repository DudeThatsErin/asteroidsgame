# Asteroids
This is a game I made to test my knowledge of C++.

If you want to run this game for yourself, go to the Releases section on the right side and download and run the .exe file.

## Features
- Plays sounds when each lasers type is used
- Big Lasers only work on bigger asteroids and small bullets only work on smaller asteroids.
  - The lasers have unique sounds to them as well.
- Game Over Screen
- Start Menu/Screen
- 10 Levels that get progressively harder as you go through them.
    - 10th level is an unlimited level where you can just shoot and gain as many points as possible.
- Utilizes WASD keys for movement & left and right mouse buttons for shooting.
- Enter & Escape for menu screens.

## Usage Instructions
If you would like to play this game. Head over to "Releases" on the right side and download the `Asteroids_V#.zip` file where the pound sign stands for the version number.

Once you download it. Extract it to where you would like to keep the game.
